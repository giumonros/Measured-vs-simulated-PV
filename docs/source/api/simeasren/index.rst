.. py:function:: load_pv_setup_from_meas_file(location_name: str) -> dict

   Load PV plant setup parameters from the measured data Excel file (in data/measured_PV)

   This function reads the `"PV_plant_setup"` sheet from the measured PV data Excel
   file for a given location and returns the contents as a dictionary, with the
   Excel sheet's `"Parameter"` column as keys and the `"Value"` column as values.

   :param location_name: Name of the location/site corresponding to the Excel file (without extension),
                         e.g., `"Turin"`. The function expects the file to exist in:
                         ```
                         data/measured_PV/{location_name}.xlsx
                         ```
   :type location_name: str

   :returns: Dictionary containing PV plant setup parameters. Keys correspond to parameter
             names (from the `"Parameter"` column in Excel), and values are the corresponding
             setup values.
   :rtype: dict

   :raises FileNotFoundError: If the measured PV Excel file for the specified location does not exist.

   .. rubric:: Notes

   - The Excel sheet must be named `"PV_plant_setup"` with columns `"Parameter"` and `"Value"`.

.. py:function:: calculate_error_metrics(data_sim_meas, location_name, plot_palette=None, exclude_non_palette=True)

   Calculate PV simulation error metrics relative to measured data.

   This function computes key statistical error metrics — Mean Difference,
   Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) — for each
   simulation tool relative to measured PV data for a specific location.
   The outputs are structured as lists of dictionaries, ready for plotting
   or further analysis.

   :param data_sim_meas: DataFrame containing measured and simulated PV data for a given location.
                         Columns should include one `"PV-MEAS"` column for measured data and
                         one or more simulation tool columns (e.g., `"Turin PV-SIM1"`).
   :type data_sim_meas: pandas.DataFrame
   :param location_name: Name of the location (e.g., `"Turin"`) used to filter relevant columns
                         and label outputs.
   :type location_name: str

                        If None, no filtering is applied based on the palette.
   :type plot_palette: dict, optional
   :param exclude_non_palette: If True, only simulation tools listed in `plot_palette` are included.
                               If False, all simulation columns are processed regardless of the palette.
   :type exclude_non_palette: bool, optional (default=True)

   :returns: A tuple `(mean_diff_results, mae_results, rmse_results)` where each element
             is a list of dictionaries with the following structure:
             - `"Location"` : str — name of the location
             - `"Tool"` : str — simulation tool name
             - `"Mean Difference (%)"` / `"MAE (%)"` / `"RMSE (%)"` : float — computed metric
   :rtype: tuple of lists

   :raises None: Missing `'PV-MEAS'` column is handled by returning empty lists.
       Columns with insufficient data (empty after NaN removal) are skipped.

   .. rubric:: Notes

   - Metrics are calculated in **percent (%)** by multiplying the raw value by 100.
   - The function aligns indices of simulated and measured data to handle missing values.
   - Tool names are extracted from column names by splitting at whitespace and
     using the second part if available.

   .. rubric:: Examples

   >>> from simeasren import calculate_error_metrics
   >>> df = pd.read_csv("Turin_meas_sim.csv")
   >>> mean_diff, mae, rmse = calculate_error_metrics(
   ...     data_sim_meas=df,
   ...     location_name="Turin"
   ... )
   >>> mean_diff[0]
   {'Location': 'Turin', 'Tool': 'PV-SIM1', 'Mean Difference (%)': 2.34}
   >>> mae[0]
   {'Location': 'Turin', 'Tool': 'PV-SIM1', 'MAE (%)': 3.12}
   >>> rmse[0]
   {'Location': 'Turin', 'Tool': 'PV-SIM1', 'RMSE (%)': 4.05}

   This function reads measured PV data from an Excel file, combines it with any number
   of simulated PV datasets provided as dictionaries, and saves the merged dataset
   for further analysis or plotting. Each simulation source should be a dictionary
   where keys are identifiers and values are hourly PV power arrays.

   :param location_name: Name of the location/site (e.g., `"Almeria"`) used for file paths and labeling.
   :type location_name: str

                               - Keys : str — unique identifiers (e.g., `"Almeria2023 PG2-SARAH"`)
                               - Values : numpy.ndarray — hourly PV power output in kW.
   :type \*simulated_sources: dict
   :param output_dir: Root directory where the merged CSV will be saved (default is `"results"`).
   :type output_dir: str, optional

   :returns: The function writes a CSV file to:

   Load, clean, and prepare all measured and simulated PV datasets
   for subsequent time series and high-resolution plotting.

   This function consolidates and preprocesses photovoltaic (PV) performance data
   by loading measured Excel files and corresponding simulated CSV outputs for a given
   location and year. It also merges high-resolution daily data (clear and cloudy sky)
   with hourly simulation results to ensure consistent plotting inputs.

   :param location_name: Name of the PV site or measurement location (e.g., "Almeria", "Turin", "Utrecht").
                         Must match the filename in the `data/measured_PV/` directory
   :type location_name: str
   :param year: Specific year to filter the simulation data (e.g., `"2023"`). The year should exist
                in the measured data files
   :type year: str

   :returns: * **data_sim_meas** (*pd.DataFrame*) -- Hourly simulated and measured PV data (limited to 8760 hours for a full year).
               Columns include simulated and measured normalized power outputs per model/tool.
             * **clear_sky_df** (*pd.DataFrame*) -- Processed and merged clear-sky day data, combining high-resolution measured
               values with corresponding simulation results.
             * **cloudy_sky_df** (*pd.DataFrame*) -- Processed and merged cloudy-sky day data, combining high-resolution measured
               values with corresponding simulation results.

   :raises FileNotFoundError: If the measured PV Excel file for the specified location does not exist.
   :raises UserWarning: If the specified year is not found in the dataset, resulting in empty outputs.

   .. rubric:: Notes

   - Measured PV data are expected in:
     ```
     data/measured_PV/{location_name}.xlsx
     ```
     with sheet names `"Clear sky day"` and `"Cloudy sky day"`.
   - Simulated PV results must exist in:
     ```
     results/{location_name}/simulated_pv/{location_name}_meas_sim.csv
     ```
   - Helper functions used:
     - `convert_comma_to_dot()` for numeric conversion.
     - `extract_year_selected()` for extracting year tags from column names.

.. py:function:: calculate_all_LCOF_diff(data_sim_meas, location_name, H2_end_user_min_load, solver_name, technoeco_file_name='Techno_eco_data_NH3')

   Calculate the difference in Levelized Cost of Fuel (LCOF) between
   measured and simulated data for a given location.

   This function performs a techno-economic analysis by comparing the
   measured energy production profile with multiple simulated profiles
   for the specified location. For each dataset, it computes the LCOF
   using the `solve_optiplant` optimization model, stores detailed
   results and flow data as CSV files, and calculates the relative
   difference in LCOF between measured and simulated cases.

   :param data_sim_meas: DataFrame containing both simulated and measured time-series data
                         for one or more locations. Each column name should include the
                         location name, and the measured data column should contain "PV-MEAS".
   :type data_sim_meas: pandas.DataFrame
   :param location_name: Name of the location to analyze (used to filter columns in
                         `data_sim_meas`).
   :type location_name: str
   :param H2_end_user_min_load: Minimum hydrogen end-user load (fraction of nominal load)
                                to be considered in the techno-economic model.
   :type H2_end_user_min_load: float
   :param solver_name: Name of the optimization solver to use (e.g., "PULP_CBC_CMD",
                       "GUROBI_CMD", "CPLEX_CMD").
   :type solver_name: str
   :param technoeco_file_name: Base filename (without extension) of the techno-economic data CSV file.
                               Defaults to "Techno_eco_data_NH3".
   :type technoeco_file_name: str, optional

   :returns: A list of dictionaries, each containing:

             - "Location" (str): Name of the analyzed location.
             - "Tool" (str): Identifier of the simulation tool or dataset.
             - "LCOF Difference (%)" (float): Relative difference in LCOF between
               simulated and measured data.
   :rtype: list of dict

   :raises FileNotFoundError: If the specified techno-economic CSV file does not exist.
   :raises ValueError: If no measured data column (containing "PV-MEAS") is found for the
       given location.

   .. rubric:: Notes

   The function assumes that the `solve_optiplant()` function is available
   in the current environment and returns:
   (LCOF_value, technoeco_results_df, flow_results_df).

   Intermediate results (system costs and hourly flow profiles) are saved
   automatically in the folders `System size and costs` and `Hourly profiles`

   .. rubric:: Examples

   Import and run the function using a CSV with simulated and measured PV data:

       >>> import pandas as pd
       >>> from simeasren import calculate_all_LCOF_diff
       >>> data = pd.read_csv("Utrecht_meas_sim.csv")
       >>> results = calculate_all_LCOF_diff(
       ...     data_sim_meas=data,
       ...     location_name="Utrecht",
       ...     H2_end_user_min_load=0.3,
       ...     solver_name="PULP_CBC_CMD",
       ...     technoeco_file_name="Techno_eco_data_NH3"
       ... )

.. py:function:: solve_optiplant(data_units, PV_profile, H2_end_user_min_load, solver_name)

   Perform a techno-economic optimization of an integrated energy system.

   This function formulates and solves a linear programming (LP) model
   to determine the optimal design and operation of an energy system
   (e.g., hydrogen and ammonia production plant). It minimizes the
   total annualized cost subject to technical, economic, and operational
   constraints, using the specified solver.

   The optimization considers investment, fixed and variable O&M costs,
   production rates, storage balances, renewable profiles, and
   techno-economic parameters for each subsystem. It returns both
   aggregated economic results and detailed hourly flow data.

   :param data_units: DataFrame containing techno-economic parameters for all system units.
                      Must include the following columns:
                      - `"Type of units"`
                      - `"Subsets"`, `"Subsets_2"`, `"Produced from"`
                      - `"H2 balance"`, `"El balance"`
                      - `"Max Capacity"`
                      - `"Load min (percent of max capacity)"`
                      - `"Electrical consumption (kWh/output)"`
                      - `"Fuel production rate (kg output/kg input)"`
                      - `"Investment (EUR/Capacity installed)"`
                      - `"Fixed cost (EUR/Capacity installed/y)"`
                      - `"Variable cost (EUR/Output)"`
                      - `"Yearly demand (kg fuel)"`
                      - `"Annuity factor"`
                      - `"Used (1 or 0)"`
                      - `"Legend flows"`

                      These data define the structure, interconnections, and cost
                      characteristics of each unit in the modeled system.
   :type data_units: pandas.DataFrame
   :param PV_profile: DataFrame containing the renewable power (e.g., solar PV) time-series profile
                      used as the main input energy source. Must have at least one column
                      with hourly values.
   :type PV_profile: pandas.DataFrame
   :param H2_end_user_min_load: Minimum allowable load for the hydrogen end-user unit (as a fraction of
                                maximum capacity, e.g., `0.3` for 30%).
   :type H2_end_user_min_load: float
   :param solver_name: Name of the LP solver to use. Examples include:
                       - `"GUROBI_CMD"` (recommended, requires license)
                       - `"PULP_CBC_CMD"` (open-source)
   :type solver_name: str

   :returns: A tuple `(fuel_cost, df_results, df_flows)` where:

             - `fuel_cost` (`float`): Production cost of the main fuel (EUR/t).
             - `df_results` (`pandas.DataFrame`): Summary of techno-economic results for each unit,
               including investment, O&M costs, production, capacity, and cost breakdowns.
             - `df_flows` (`pandas.DataFrame`): Detailed time-series of unit flows, power consumption,
               and electricity use.

             Example:
             ```python
             (
                 875.3,                            # Fuel cost (EUR/t)
                 <DataFrame: techno-economic summary>,
                 <DataFrame: hourly flow results>
             )
             ```
   :rtype: tuple

   :raises ValueError: If required columns are missing from `data_units`, or if the optimization
       produces no results.
   :raises RuntimeError: If the solver fails to find an optimal solution.

   .. rubric:: Notes

   - Maintenance periods and partial operation times are modeled explicitly
     (e.g., `TMstart`, `TMend`, `Tbegin`, `Tfinish`).
   - The model assumes steady-state balance of electricity and hydrogen at each timestep.
   - Storage dynamics are represented with inflow/outflow constraints and
     mass balance equations.
   - The cost objective includes investment annuities, fixed, and variable O&M components.
   - The hydrogen end-user minimal load constraint is modified based on
     `H2_end_user_min_load`.

   The LP model is constructed using **PuLP** and solved using the chosen backend solver.
   Optimal solutions typically take 5-10 seconds with Gurobi and 180 seconds with cbc.
