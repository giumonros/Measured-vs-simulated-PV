# PV data comparison

The package propose various functions and plots to compare simulated and measured data:
- ``calculate_error_metrics``: calculate Mean Difference, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for each simulation tool relative to measured PV data for a specific location
- ``generate_PV_timeseries_plots``: generate time-series comparison plots for measured and simulated data including `Capacity factor duration curve`, `Scatter comparison plot` and `Error metrics bar charts`
- generate_high_res_PV_plots
- generate_PV_plots
