# Simeasren documentation

Welcome to the Simeasren documentation.

This package has been created based on the work presented in this [article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2024.115044)

The aim of this package is to facilate the data sharing of measured PV profiles, compare measured and simulated PV power production data, and
analyse the influence of using measured or simulated PV power data for e-fuel techno-economic assessments. 

The installation tutorial is available [here](installation.md)
